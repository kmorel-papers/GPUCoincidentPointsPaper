@article{Dyken2008,
abstract = {We describe the cloning and analysis of two overlapping DNA fragments from Streptomyces coelicolor that cause aerial mycelium to appear more rapidly than usual when introduced into Streptomyces lividans on a low-copy-number plasmid vector. Colonies of S. lividans TK64 harboring either clone produce visible aerial mycelia after only 48 h of growth, rather than the usual 72 to 96 h. From deletion and sequence analysis, this rapid aerial mycelium (Ram) phenotype appears to be due to a cluster of three genes that we have designated ramA, ramB, and ramR. Both ramA and ramB potentially encode 65-kDa proteins with homology to ATP-dependent membrane-translocating proteins. A chromosomal ramB disruption mutant of S. lividans was found to be severely defective in aerial mycelium formation. ramR could encode a 21-kDa protein with significant homology to the UhpA subset of bacterial two-component response regulator proteins. The overall organization and potential proteins encoded by the cloned DNA suggest that this is the S. coelicolor homolog of the amf gene cluster that has been shown to be important for aerial mycelium formation in Streptomyces griseus. However, despite the fact that the two regions probably have identical functions, there is relatively poor homology between the two gene clusters at the DNA sequence level.},

@article{Bank2003,
abstract = {We present a new approach to the use of parallel computers with adaptive finite element methods. This approach addresses the load balancing problem in a new way, requiring far less communication than current approaches. It also allows existing sequential adaptive PDE codes such as PLTMG and MC to run in a parallel environment without a large investment in recoding. In this new approach, the load balancing problem is reduced to the numerical solution of a small elliptic problem on a single processor, using a sequential adaptive solver, without requiring any modifications to the sequential solver. The small elliptic problem is used to produce a posteriori error estimates to predict future element densities in the mesh, which are then used in a weighted recursive spectral bisection of the initial mesh. The bulk of the calculation then takes place independently on each processor, with no communication, using possibly the same sequential adaptive solver. Each processor adapts its region of the mesh independently, and a nearly load-balanced mesh distribution is usually obtained as a result of the initial weighted spectral bisection. Only the initial fan-out of the mesh decomposition to the processors requires communication. Two additional steps requiring boundary exchange communication may be employed after the individual processors reach an adapted solution, namely, the construction of a global conforming mesh from the independent subproblems, followed by a final smoothing phase using the subdomain solutions as an initial guess. We present a series of convincing numerical experiments that illustrate the effectiveness of this approach. The justification of the initial refinement prediction step, as well as the justification of skipping the two communication-intensive steps, is supported by some recent J. Xu and A. Zhou, Math. Comp., 69 (2000), pp. 881-909 and not so recent J. A. Nitsche and A. H. Schatz, Math. Comp., 28 (1974), pp. 937-958; A. H. Schatz and L. B. Wahlbin, Math. Comp., 31 (1977), pp. 414-442; A. H. Schatz and L. B. Wahlbin, Math. Comp., 64 (1995), pp. 907-928 results on local a priori and a posteriori error estimation. This revision of the original article R. E. Bank and M. J. Holst, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 22 (2000), pp. 1411-1443 updates the numerical experiments and reflects the knowledge we have gained since the original paper appeared.},

@article{Lorensen1987,
abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called marching cubes, that creates triangle models of constant density surfaces from 3D medical data. Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

@article{Hoppe1996,
abstract = {Highly detailed geometric models are rapidly becoming common- place in computer graphics. These models, often represented as complex triangle meshes, challenge rendering performance, trans- mission bandwidth, and storage capacities. This paper introduces the progressive mesh (PM) representation, a newscheme for storing and transmitting arbitrary triangle meshes. This efficient, loss- less, continuous-resolution representation addresses several practi- cal problems in graphics: smooth geomorphing of level-of-detail approximations, progressive transmission, mesh compression, and selective refinement. In addition, we present a new mesh simplification procedure for constructing a PMrepresentation from an arbitrary mesh. The goal of this optimization procedure is to preserve not just the geometry of the original mesh, but more importantly its overall appearance as defined by its discrete and scalar appearance attributes such as material identifiers, color values, normals, and texture coordinates. We demonstrate construction of the PM representation and its ap- plications using several practical models.},

Abstract = {Large-scale visualization systems are typically designed to efficiently ``push'' datasets through the graphics hardware. However, exploratory visualization systems are increasingly expected to support scalable data manipulation, restructuring, and querying capabilities in addition to core visualization algorithms. We posit that new emerging abstractions for parallel data processing, in particular computing clouds, can be leveraged to support large-scale data exploration through visualization. In this paper, we take a first step in evaluating the suitability of the MapReduce framework to implement large-scale visualization techniques. MapReduce is a lightweight, scalable, general-purpose parallel data processing framework increasingly popular in the context of cloud computing. Specifically, we implement and evaluate a representative suite of visualization tasks (mesh rendering, isosurface extraction, and mesh simplification) as MapReduce programs, and report quantitative performance results applying these algorithms to realistic datasets. For example, we perform isosurface extraction of up to l6 isovalues for volumes composed of 27 billion voxels, simplification of meshes with 30GBs of data and subsequent rendering with image resolutions up to 800002 pixels. Our results indicate that the parallel scalability, ease of use, ease of access to computing resources, and fault-tolerance of MapReduce offer a promising foundation for a combined data manipulation and data visualization system deployed in a public cloud or a local commodity cluster.},
