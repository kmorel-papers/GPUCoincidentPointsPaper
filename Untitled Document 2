Title: Finely Threaded Topological Connection Reconstruction

Abstract:
Many algorithms applied to mesh-based data structures are easily parallelizable because operations 
 can often be divided by the constituent elements of the mesh and 
 parallelized with a large number of threads.  The problem with this technique is 
 that when these threads generate new topological features, they tend to
 generate redundant information such as coincident vertices.  This 
 ``soup'' of elements requires significant additional memory to store and fails to capture the adjacency of neighboring 
 elements.  We present a novel approach for the efficient construction 
 of connected topologies on multi- and many-core systems, which we demonstrate with 
 GPU and OpenMP implementations. In this approach, we use input
 topological features as a basis for efficient location of coincident
 features in the output.  We provide examples and performance numbers of the technique for 
 isosurface generation and multiple forms of tetrahedralization.
